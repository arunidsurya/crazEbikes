        description: "The Vitus e-Sommet VRS mountain bike has the trail performance and travel of a 170mm enduro bike with a Shimano motor under the hood that kills the climbs and extends access to the most technical trails. Experience the rush - the short snapshots that flood your senses and put you deep into a focused trance. The feeling of total control as you float from the start to the finish line and race down the slopes, from the bike park to the big mountain. The rush when you roll out at the end of the trail and make one final sprint. The rush that drives you to explore your limits without going overboard. Missed the last lift? That doesn't matter. With the proven E7000 drive you'll be back at the trailhead quickly.  The e-Sommet VRS is designed to operate with a mullet wheel setup. A 27.5-inch rear wheel gives you more clearance on steep terrain and is more responsive in tight corners, while a 29-inch front wheel soaks up rocky terrain and keeps momentum high. This means you benefit from the versatility of both wheel sizes in one bike. The stability of the all-aluminum frame with seamlessly integrated battery is rock-solid, so you don't ride just any track, but take the best track. This bike is so precise that it rewards you with time. Time to head for the next obstacle and choose your route as the trail unfolds before you. The powerful STEPS system with the internal E8035 504 Wh battery keeps you fresh on the climbs so you can hit the ground running on the descents.  The e-Sommet VRS is a bike you sit IN, not ON. It offers a powerful riding position that gives you full control. Build your confidence on the dramatic slopes and challenging elements of a bike park, but also take a step into the wilderness, where this bike really comes to life and enjoys the unpredictability of the natural, technical terrain. Speed ​​and traction are easy for the e-Sommet. It thrives in the chaos of steep and challenging trails. It brings calm where things are hectic all around.",
